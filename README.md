# Faker
Faker will be a replacement for https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker, which is sadly not maintained anymore and archived.

The main goals are:
- PHP 8 support
- PHP 7.4 required
- Less monolithic approach, e.g. extracting language additions as separate libraries faker-german
- Split up logic from static data
- Interface should be as close as possible to https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker.
